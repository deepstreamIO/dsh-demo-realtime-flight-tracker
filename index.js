/**
 *0  icao24  string  Unique ICAO 24-bit address of the transponder in hex string representation.
  1 callsign  string  Callsign of the vehicle (8 chars). Can be null if no callsign has been received.
  2 origin_country  string  Country name inferred from the ICAO 24-bit address.
  3 time_position float Unix timestamp (seconds) for the last position update. Can be null if no position report was received by OpenSky within the past 15s.
  4 time_velocity float Unix timestamp (seconds) for the last velocity update. Can be null if no velocity report was received by OpenSky within the past 15s.
  5 longitude float WGS-84 longitude in decimal degrees. Can be null.
  6 latitude  float WGS-84 latitude in decimal degrees. Can be null.
  7 altitude  float Barometric or geometric altitude in meters. Can be null.
  8 on_ground boolean Boolean value which indicates if the position was retrieved from a surface position report.
  9 velocity  float Velocity over ground in m/s. Can be null.
  10  heading float Heading in decimal degrees clockwise from north (i.e. north=0Â°). Can be null.
  11  vertical_rate float Vertical rate in m/s. A positive value indicates that the airplane is climbing, a negative value indicates that it descends. Can be null.
